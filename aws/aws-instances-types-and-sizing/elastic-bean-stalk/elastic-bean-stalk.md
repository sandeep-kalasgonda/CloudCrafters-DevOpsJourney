# Deployment of Application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This document provides a step-by-step guide on deploying an application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying your application, ensure you have the following:
- An AWS account with necessary permissions.
- A working application with a `Procfile` and `Buildfile` (if required).

## Steps to Deploy the Application

### Step 1: Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application
1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **Elastic Beanstalk**.
3. Click **Create Application**.
4. Enter an **Application name** and choose a **Platform** (e.g., Node.js, Python, or Docker).
5. Click **Create**.

### Step 2: Create an Environment
1. In the Elastic Beanstalk Console, click **Create environment**.
2. Select **Web server environment**.
3. Choose the application you created earlier.
4. Configure **Environment name, Domain, and Platform**.
5. Click **Create environment** and wait for AWS to provision resources.

### Step 3: Upload and Deploy the Application
1. In the **Elastic Beanstalk Console**, go to your environment.
2. Click **Upload and Deploy**.
3. Choose your application package (`.zip` or `.war` file).
4. Click **Deploy** and wait for the deployment to complete.

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment Logs
1. In the Elastic Beanstalk Console, navigate to **Logs**.
2. Click **Request Logs** to view recent application logs.
3. Use **Monitoring** to check environment health and performance.

### Step 5: Access the Application
Once deployed, the application will be available at the **Environment URL** displayed in the console. Example:
```
http://Newbean2-env.eba-v7q9ye5m.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

### Step 6: Scaling and Managing the Application
Elastic Beanstalk automatically creates an Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer:
- To scale up/down manually, modify the **Capacity settings** in the environment configuration.
- Check environment health in the **Health** tab.
- To terminate the environment, click **Actions â†’ Terminate Environment**.

## Additional Configuration
- **Procfile**: Defines how the application should start.
- **Buildfile**: Specifies build commands for dependencies.
- **Elastic Beanstalk Console**: Provides an interface to manage environments and monitor metrics.

## Troubleshooting
- If deployment fails, check logs in the **Logs** section of the console.
- Verify that all required environment variables are set in AWS.
- Ensure that dependencies and configurations are correctly specified in the application files.

## Conclusion
Your application is now successfully deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. You can manage, scale, and monitor it using the Elastic Beanstalk Console.
