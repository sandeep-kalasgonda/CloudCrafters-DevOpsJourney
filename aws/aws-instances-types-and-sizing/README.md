### **2. EC2 Instance Pricing**

Pricing for EC2 instances depends on several factors:  
- **Instance Type**  
- **Region**  
- **Pricing Model** (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, Savings Plans)  
- **Storage (EBS)**  
- **Data Transfer Costs**  

#### **Pricing Models:**

1. **On-Demand Pricing:**
   - Pay for compute capacity by the second (or hour depending on the instance type).
   - **Best for:** Short-term, unpredictable workloads.
   
   **Example:** `t3.micro` in **US East (N. Virginia)** costs about **$0.0104 per hour**.

2. **Reserved Instances:**
   - Reserved for 1 or 3 years with a commitment.
   - **Best for:** Steady-state, long-term workloads.
   - **Pricing:** Save up to 75% compared to on-demand pricing.

3. **Spot Instances:**
   - Purchase unused capacity at a significant discount (up to 90%).
   - **Best for:** Flexible, fault-tolerant workloads.
   - **Example:** Running batch processing jobs or AI training during low-demand times.

4. **Savings Plans:**
   - Flexible pricing model with commitment (1 or 3 years).
   - **Best for:** Predictable workloads that can use instance types across multiple regions.

#### **Sample Pricing Comparison:**

| **Instance Type**  | **On-Demand Price (per hour)** | **Reserved Price (1 year, No Upfront)** | **Spot Price (per hour)** |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|

### **3. How to Choose the Right EC2 Instance**

#### **Key Factors to Consider:**
1. **Workload Type:**  
   - General-purpose apps-Go with `T` or `M` series.
   - CPU-intensive tasks-Opt for `C` series.
   - Data-heavy workloads-Choose `R` or `X` series.
   - High storage needs-Go for `I` or `D` series.
   - Machine learning or AI tasks-Choose `P` or `G` series.

2. **Performance Requirements:**  
   - Does your workload require burstable or sustained high performance? Choose accordingly (e.g., `t3.micro` vs. `c5n.large`).

3. **Cost Considerations:**  
   - Use **On-Demand** for short-term or unpredictable workloads, **Reserved Instances** or **Savings Plans** for steady workloads, and **Spot Instances** for fault-tolerant, flexible tasks.

4. **Scalability:**  
   - Ensure the instance can handle future growth. Consider **Auto Scaling** for dynamic scaling of EC2 instances based on traffic demands.

### **4. Monitoring EC2 Instances with CloudWatch**

#### **Key EC2 Metrics to Monitor:**
1. **CPU Utilization:** Measures the percentage of allocated CPU resources used.
2. **Memory Usage:** Monitors the amount of memory (RAM) used by your instance.
3. **Disk I/O:** Tracks read/write operations on your instance’s disk.
4. **Network Traffic:** Measures incoming and outgoing network traffic.

#### **Steps to Monitor EC2 Performance:**
1. **Set Up CloudWatch Monitoring**:
   - **CloudWatch Metrics**: By default, CloudWatch monitors CPU, disk, and network metrics. For memory, you need to install the **CloudWatch Agent** (explained earlier).
   
2. **Create CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - Example: Create an alarm for CPU Utilization if it exceeds 85% for 5 minutes.
   - Navigate to **CloudWatch > Alarms > Create Alarm**, and configure thresholds based on your instance’s expected usage.

3. **Auto Scaling**:  
   - Combine CloudWatch metrics with **Auto Scaling** to dynamically add or remove EC2 instances based on performance metrics (e.g., CPU > 75% for 10 minutes triggers scaling).

### **5. Run Notes for EC2 Instance Monitoring and Management**

To maintain an organized approach to instance management, here’s how you can document your EC2 monitoring and management process:

#### **Run Notes Format Example:**

**Instance Details:**  
- **Instance ID:** i-1234567890abcdef0  
- **Instance Type:** `t3.micro`  
- **Region:** US East (N. Virginia)  
- **Launch Date:** February 3, 2025  
- **Purpose:** Hosting small web application  

**Performance Metrics to Monitor:**  
- **CPU Utilization**: Keep it under 70%. If it exceeds 75%, consider resizing or enabling Auto Scaling.  
- **Memory Usage**: Ensure it stays below 70% to avoid memory overloads. Install CloudWatch Agent to track memory metrics.

**Scaling Policy:**  
- **Scaling Trigger:** Add another instance if CPU > 80% for 10 minutes.  
- **Scaling Action:** Increase instance count by 1. Use Auto Scaling.

**Cost Monitoring:**  
- **Pricing Model:** On-Demand  
- **Hourly Cost:** $0.0104 per hour  
- **Budget Alerts:** Set an alert for when cost exceeds $50/month.

### **Conclusion**

Choosing the right EC2 instance depends on your workload, performance needs, and budget. Regular monitoring with **CloudWatch** ensures your instances are performing efficiently and scaling appropriately as demands change. Create **run notes** to document instance configurations, performance expectations, and pricing strategies for easier tracking and management.
